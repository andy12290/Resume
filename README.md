## Projects ##

## Design a Machine Learning Platform.
- Goal:Design Platform to predict loan will be paid off or not (Binary Classifier)   
- Skills Learned: Data cleaning, Data pipeline, Model building, Machine Learning, Gridsearch, randomize search, Hyper parameter tuning.
- Detail: Using past loan data from website to build models that can predict if a loan will be paid off on time or not. we are more interested in a low False Positive Rate(FPR) than a high True Positive Rate(TPR).
**Decrease the False positive rate from 80% to 7%**
