## Projects ##
------------------
## 1.Design a Machine Learning Platform.
- Goal:Design Platform to predict loan will be paid off or not (Binary Classifier)   
- Skills Learned: Data cleaning, Data pipeline, Model building, Machine Learning, Gridsearch, randomize search, Hyper parameter tuning.
- Detail: Using past loan data from website to build models that can predict if a loan will be paid off on time or not. we are more interested in a low False Positive Rate(FPR) than a high True Positive Rate(TPR).
- **False positive rate decrease from 80% to 7%**   
- [Code Details](https://github.com/andy12290/Predictive_Analytics_Project)

## 2.Pricing Test:
- Skills learned – Tableau, Python, Pandas, Model building, Exploratory Analysis.
- Goal: The goal here is to evaluate whether a pricing test running on the site has been successful.As  always, we should focus on user segmentation and provide insights about segments who behave differently as well as any other insights you might find.

## 3.IPL Data Analysis (Data Warehouse Project):
- Skills learned: Data Warehouse concept, SQL, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Excel, Spark, Hortonworks, Hadoop, Database management
- Goal: Build Data warehouse for IPL data by using the Hive database and Oracle database.
- Data analysis by using the Python on top the data warehouse.
- [Code Details](https://github.com/andy12290/Datawarehouse)

## 4.Predict Conversion Rate (Stub hub company data):
- Skills learned: Model building, Handling imbalanced classification data, KNN, Naïve, Logistic regression algorithm
- Goal: Predict Conversion rate of customer by analyzing the past conversion data.
- [Code Details](https://github.com/andy12290/Data_Mining_Challenge)

## 5.TensorFlow Deep learning:
- Goal: Learn the TensorFlow deep learning Library.
- Deep learning challenge to predict the earthquake by using TensorFlow Ml lib
- [Code Details](https://github.com/andy12290/Tensorflow-Deep-Learning)

## 6.Predict Dropout Rate by using Multiple Regression:
- Skills Learned- Multiple Linear regression, Business Analytics class  final Project, Python, Pandas, Numpy, scikitlearn
- Goal: Predict dropout rate state wise by using Multiple Regression.

## 7.Flex Project Development and Support (Mainframe Technology):
- Skills Learned:  COBOL, JCL, SQL, Mainframe Technology, Generate reports
- Developed and implemented COBOL programs to process AMA applications and HSA application such as check writing ACH and/or debit card services through Batch processing.

## 8.Kaggle Competition (Text Analysis Problem) :
- Goal: Use recipe ingredients to categorize the cuisine  
- Kaggle Public Dashboard Accuracy: 75 Percent(Rank<1000)

## 9.Web scraping :
- Libraries: Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Numpy  
- Goal: To scrape the data from the HTML pages into the Pandas data frame.
- [Code Details](https://github.com/andy12290/Web-scraping "Git hub details")

## 10.Web Analytics:
- Skills: Google Analytics, Tableau, Python
- Design our own educational website in order to help new programmers or Data science.
